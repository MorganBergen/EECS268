@brief	    this is the implementation details that will test the time complexity of printing all elements in the ADT linkedList using get_entry()
            by utilizing this class the following will happen
            1.  a linkedList will have inserted 1000 elements into the list
            2.  a record of the time to perform a print(self.list.size) get_entry at the last index will be allocated to the self.time list built in data structure
            3.  step 1 and 2 will be repeated, increasing the size by 1,000 each time untill the linkedlist has pushed 100,000 times
